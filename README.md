# Example Code for Javassist Talk on Javaland 2018

This are simple examples presented in my talk on JavaLand 2018. The code is just meant to play with Javassist.

To use the Agent build the `agent.jar` with maven:
```
  $ mvn package
```

The `agent.jar` can then be found at `agent/target/agent.jar`.
