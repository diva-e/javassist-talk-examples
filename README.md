# Example Code for [Javassist](http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/) Talk on JavaLand 2018

These are simple examples presented in [my talk on JavaLand 2018](https://programm.javaland.eu/2018/?redirect_fragment=%2Fschedule#/scheduledEvent/549395). The code is just meant to play with Javassist.

To use the Agent build the `agent.jar` with maven:
```
  $ mvn package
```

The `agent.jar` can then be found at `agent/target/agent.jar`.
